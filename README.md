# ZuhlkeCodingTest
Simple "kata-like" test as part of Zuhlke interview process.

We'll be asking you to write a simple program from scratch based
on a domain problem that we'll send you at the time.
We hope you'll find it straightforward
(we're not looking for clever algorithms).

## Prep for test

### Brief

In preparation, could you set up a new project in your usual 
environment with a single failing test. 
It will only be domain code, no user interactions. 
I believe we have agreed the development language which is Java. 
You don't need to set up a full modular project, 
unless you want to, as we'll only be writing a small amount of code.

### Design

As I am now working on a new Linux operating system (Mint) 
and previously I was using IntelliJ on Windows 10, I will need to
go through a full TDD cycle with GIT commits to check all is working.

* IntelliJ gives a starter project with a simple main class, already created
* IntelliJ uses master branch my default, so will need to swap to main branch as it is more GitHubby
* Also want to use packages, for consistency
* TODO:
  * Move Main to com.tinkabell.zuhlke
  * Modify Main to have method helloWorld() and use it in main() method
  * Add failing test for helloWorld()
  * Fix the test
  * Run commits for each phase
